# Learning-CoreJAVA
Description of what I've done in the program:

1) <b>corej1.java</b> - Simple 'for' iterative loop for printing natural numbers upto 10.
2) factorial.java - program for the calculation of factorial of number 'n' using 'for' loop.
3) sum30.java - program for the calculation of the first 30 natural numbers excluding 10,20 and 30.
4) greatest3.java - an object oriented programming and functional programming concept on as to how one can compute the greatest of 3 numbers. 
5)  greatestcmdl3.java - an object oriented programming and functional programming concept on as to how one can compute the greatest of 3 numbers inputted by the user on command prompt. 

Tools required : 
- JDK (JAVA Development Kit) which can be downloaded from "https://java.com/download"
- Command prompt (as I am using Windows environment to implement these programs)
- Notepad

P.S - You can use some other platform like BlueJ, Netbeans, etc. but I would advise you to use Notepad as it is harder to find mistakes you
committed which makes you better at debugging, atleast that's what I think.
