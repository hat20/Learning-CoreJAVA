# Learning-CoreJAVA
Description of what I've done in the program:

1) corej1.java - Simple 'for' iterative loop for printing natural numbers upto 10.
2) factorial.java - program for the calculation of factorial of number 'n' using 'for' loop.


Tools required : 
- JDK (JAVA Development Kit) which can be downloaded from "https://java.com/download"
- Command prompt (as I am using Windows environment to implement these programs)
- Notepad

P.S - You can use some other platform like BlueJ, Netbeans, etc. but I would advise you to use Notepad as it is harder to find mistakes you
committed which makes you better at debugging, atleast that's what I think.
