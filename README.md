3) <b>sum30.java</b> - program for the calculation of the first 30 natural numbers excluding 10,20 and 30.
4) <b>greatestcmdl3.java</b> - an object oriented programming and functional programming concept on as to how one can compute the greatest of 3 numbers inputted by the user on command prompt. 
5) <b>scanner_input.java</b> - a program that asks user to input the data using the Scanner class.
6) <b>factorial_input.java</b> - program for the calculation of factorial of number 'x' using 'for' loop.

8) <b>palindrome.java</b> - a program to determine whether a number is palindromic or not.
9) <b>isLeapYear.java</b> - a program to determine whether an year is a leap year or not.
10) <b>automorphic.java</b> - a program to check whether a number is automorphic or not.
11) <b>date_to_days.java</b> - a program to calculate number of days between a date you enter and 1st Jan of the same year you entered in date.
12) <b>days_btwn_dates.java</b> - a program that calculates the number of days there are in between two dates.
13) <b>array.java</b> - a program that focuses on basic array manipulations such as finding min and max elements and finding average and sum of the squares of all the elements in the array.
14) <b>Fraction.java</b> - an object oriented program to add, subtract and multiply two fractions.
15) <b>arr_move.java</b> - performing moving operations on the elements of an array.
16) <b>hcf_lcm.java</b> - calculating HCF and LCM of two positive integers.
17) <b>bubblesort.java</b> - Sorting the elements of an array using bubble sort.
18) <b>finding_element.java</b> - Searching an element in an array using linear search.
19) <b>findCharacterInString.java</b> - Searching the first occurrence of a character in a string using indexOf function.
20) <b>findStringInString.java</b> - Searching the first occurrence of a string in a sentence using indexOf function. 
21) <b>emirp.java</b> - a program to determine whether a number is EMIRP or not.
22) <b>primepalindrome.java</b> - a program to determine whether a number is prime palindrome or not.
23) <b>num_to_words.java</b> - program that outputs the digits of a number you entered in words.
24) <b>fact_recursion.java</b> - program that finds the factorial of a positive integer using recursion.
25) <b>rev_string_manipulation</b> - a program that reverses a string without affecting special characters.

<b>Tools required :</b> 

<i>In WINDOWS</i>
- JDK (JAVA Development Kit) which can be downloaded from "https://java.com/download"
- Command prompt
- Notepad

<i>In Ubuntu 16.04LTS</i>
- JDK (JAVA Development Kit) which can be installed using "sudo apt-get install openjdk-8*"
- Text Editor - you can try using the pre-installed graphical editor "gedit filename.java"
(All the above code has to be implemented in terminal Ctrl+Alt+T)

<b>Steps for implementation:</b>

<i>In WINDOWS</i>
- First you need to find the address of where the jdk is installed in your pc. It would probably be stored in a location like this "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.1\bin" or
  "WindowsDrive:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.1\bin". You need to copy the address.
- Now, open CMD and write "path= C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.1\bin" or "path= paste what you copied" which sets the path temporarily. You need to do this everytime you need to run Java programs on your PC.
- Type <b>javac</b> to check whether you were able to set the path without any errors, if you were then proceed to the next step otherwise repeat the above step and make sure that you followed it correctly.
- Make sure that you change your current directory to where your programs are stored. If you don't know how to do it then simply paste the programs on Desktop and type "cd Desktop" on CMD.
- To run the program, type <b>javac filename.java</b> then after it compiles successfully type <b>java filename</b> to run the class and see the output.
- That's it, enjoy!

<i>In Ubuntu 16.04LTS</i>
- Just change your current directory to where your programs are stored. If you don't know how to do it then simply paste the programs on Desktop and type "cd Desktop" on Terminal.
- To run the program, type <b>javac filename.java</b> then after it compiles successfully type <b>java filename</b> to run the class and see the output.
- That's it, enjoy!

P.S (for windows users) - You can use some other platform like BlueJ, Netbeans, etc. but I would advise you to use Notepad as it is harder to find mistakes you
committed which makes you better at debugging, atleast that's what I think.
