# Learning-CoreJAVA
Description of what I've done in the program:

1) <b>corej1.java</b> - Simple 'for' iterative loop for printing natural numbers upto 10.
2) <b>factorial.java</b> - program for the calculation of factorial of number 'n' using 'for' loop.
3) <b>sum30.java</b> - program for the calculation of the first 30 natural numbers excluding 10,20 and 30.
4) <b>greatest3.java</b> - an object oriented programming and functional programming concept on as to how one can compute the greatest of 3 numbers. 
5) <b>greatestcmdl3.java</b> - an object oriented programming and functional programming concept on as to how one can compute the greatest of 3 numbers inputted by the user on command prompt. 

<b>Tools required :</b> 
- JDK (JAVA Development Kit) which can be downloaded from "https://java.com/download"
- Command prompt (as I am using Windows environment to implement these programs)
- Notepad

<b>Steps for implementation:</b>
- First you need to find the address of where the jdk is installed in your pc. It would probably be stored in a location like this "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.1\bin" or
  "WindowsDrive:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.1\bin". You need to copy the address.
- Now, open CMD and write "path= C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.1\bin" or "path= paste what you copied" which sets the path temporarily. You need to do this everytime you need to run Java programs on your PC.
- Type <b>javac</b> to check whether you were able to set the path without any errors, if you were then proceed to the next step otherwise repeat the above step and make sure that you followed it correctly.
- Make sure that you change your current directory to where your programs are stored. If you don't know how to do it then simply paste the programs on Desktop and type "cd Desktop" on CMD.
- To run the program, type <b>javac filename.java</b> then after it compiles successfully type <b>java filename</b> to run the class and see the output.
- That's it, enjoy!

P.S - You can use some other platform like BlueJ, Netbeans, etc. but I would advise you to use Notepad as it is harder to find mistakes you
committed which makes you better at debugging, atleast that's what I think.
