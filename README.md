# Learning-CoreJAVA
<b>Description of programs:</b>

1) <b>corej1.java</b> - Simple 'for' iterative loop for printing natural numbers upto 10.
2) <b>factorial.java</b> - program for the calculation of factorial of number 'n' using 'for' loop.
3) <b>sum30.java</b> - program for the calculation of the first 30 natural numbers excluding 10,20 and 30.
4) <b>greatest3.java</b> - an object oriented programming and functional programming concept on as to how one can compute the greatest of 3 numbers. 
5) <b>greatestcmdl3.java</b> - an object oriented programming and functional programming concept on as to how one can compute the greatest of 3 numbers inputted by the user on command prompt. 

<b>Tools required :</b> 
- JDK (JAVA Development Kit) which can be downloaded from "https://java.com/download"
- Command prompt (as I am using Windows environment to implement these programs)
- Notepad

<b>Steps you need to follow for implementation on Command Prompt:</b>
-You need to first locate where jdk has been installed (it would look something like this "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.1\bin" or  "Windows Directory"/Program Files -> JAVA -> jdk -> bin).
- Now open CMD and type " path= whatever you just copied in step 1". For eg. I need to write "path= C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.1\bin" on my system everytime I open CMD and have to implement Java programs (Make sure that it is "path=" and not "path =").
- After you've executed the above step, type javac in the terminal to see if you were able to set the path or not. If you couldn't, it will give you an error and you need to repeat the above steps.
- Now, write code on Notepad and save it as .java file.
- Execute the code as <b>javac filename.java</b>
- Now, if there are no errors then to see the output type <b>java filename</b> to implement the Java class.

P.S - You can use some other platform like BlueJ, Netbeans, etc. but I would advise you to use <b>Notepad </b> as it is harder to find an error which makes you better at debugging, atleast that's what I think.
